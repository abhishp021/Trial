Step 1 - This is a trial. I don't know but I have already cloned a file. Tutorial link-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Clau1bYco&ab_channel=ProgrammingKnowledge2
step 2 - Wow pushed it. Was getting some error but used this website https://komodor.com/learn/how-to-fix-failed-to-push-some-refs-to-git-errors/#:~:text=A%20commit%20gets%20rejected%20and,compatible%20with%20the%20remote%20origin.&text=Based%20on%20the%20above%2C%20your,missing%20commits%20C%20and%20D.

Step 3 - Now will again push. Last time while pushing used "git pull origin"
Step 4 - Now will pull again. Last time push with "git pull -u origin". Note here we I did not use '-u origin master'

Step 5 - Now I have moved the folder from one location to other. Now I will commit it in current parent folder of Github and then try to link with github--  Took clue from "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11384928/change-git-repository-directory-location"

Step 6 - Don't know what happened changes not updating in Github.
First I added "git add abc.txt"
Then "git status"  but it showed everything is up to date. Even used "git push -u origin" But nothing changed it said everything up to date. Now this statement added from PC. Now will check status

Step 7 - Now from github website. Earlier there should have been no problem because after adding "git add abc.txt" I was not commiting and hence it showed everything up to date but this time it update when I used "git add abc.txt" --> "git status" --> "git commit -m "my message i.e. new commit" --> "git push -u origin". After these my file in github got updated. Now I will pull it in pc by "git pull origin" after saving changes. Note here I did not use 'git pull -u origin'

Step 8 - Now everytime I have to add git file before committing don't know why.Now trying it with "git commit -a -m "commit_msg"
